# dougify
Boilerplate maker for custom Shopify theme development

## Getting Started
```
npm install --global dougify (available 1/25 after ~11am CST)
```

### Usage
1. Get up and running with ThemeKit (just get a password, don't create a config.yml file): https://shopify.dev/themes/tools/theme-kit
2. Create 2 themes for your store, one for development and one for production. Note the Theme ID for both.
3. `cd` into your project root
4. Run the `dougify` command. Boilerplate will be built and dependancies will be installed, then the dev server will start.
